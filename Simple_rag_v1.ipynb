I am proﬁcient in problem-solving, data analysis, and\\nstatistical techniques developed through coursework and a research project. On a personal level, I enjoy spending time\\nwith people, doing sports, reading books (specially if written by Carlos Ruiz Zafon) and playing video games. I consider\\nhumour to be a fundamental part of life.\\nEDUCATION\\nM.Sc. in Physics (2:1)\\nUniversity of Bristol\\nὌ5Oct 2019 – 2023\\nCourses include: Computational Physics; Quantum Information Theory; Advanced Quantum Mechanics; Relativistic Field Theory;\\nGeneral Relativity and Cosmology; Methods for Theoretical Physicist; Analytical Mechanics; Solid State Physics; Thermal Physics;\\nProjects\\nExploring Quantum Non-Equilibrium Steady States as Thermal Machines\\nQuantum Thermodynamics. M.Sc. Project.\\n•Aim: To test the validity regime of the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR) by simulating the interaction between\\ntwo qubits performing work on a load.\\n•Methods: Producing two codes with diﬀerent approaches, Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures, to calculate numerically\\nthe relevant observables, making use of ordinary diﬀerential equation solvers amongst other techniques.\\n•Results: We found that the TUR quantum bound could be violated for a range of the entropy production rate, opening\\na line of research towards understanding the restrictions of the TUR for quantum systems.\\nMeasuring the lifetime of an unstable particle\\nComputational Physics. Final Project.\\n•Aim: To simulate an experiment designed to measure the lifetime of an unstable particle before decaying.\\n•Methods: Code created by using Monte Carlo methods to simulate the production, decay, and detection of particle X\\nand its daughter.\\n•Results: By extrapolating back from hit positions, the decay vertex position was reconstructed. Using the distribution\\nof decay points, along with the known average beam velocity, the mean lifetime of the particle X was estimated.\\nExcellent verbal and written communication skills - for the Final and Group Project, I had to create and expose a presen-\\ntation, introducing and explaining complex and deep concepts to my colleagues, who were unfamiliar with these topics.\\nThis helped me to further develop my ability to explain and transmit diﬃcult concepts in an eﬃcient way.\\nEXPERIENCE\\nWaiter\\nTapas Revolution Restaurant\\nὌ5Aug 2018 – Apr 2023 ♂¶ap-¶arkerBath\\n•Addressed customer requests promptly, providing personalised service and ensuring a positive dining experience.\\n•Collaborated with waitstaﬀ and kitchen staﬀ in fast-paced environments, adjusting priorities and multitasking eﬀectively.\\nADDITIONAL SKILLS\\nCoding Languages\\nPython, Matlab, LaTeXLanguages\\nSpanish: C2 (Native), English: C1Driving licence\\nB', metadata={'source': 'RAUL GONZALEZ RAMOS (1).pdf', 'page': 0})]"
